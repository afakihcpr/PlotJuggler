# How to build

First of all you need to clone the repository and its submodules either using the command:

      git clone --recursive https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler.git

or

      git clone https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler.git
      cd PlotJuggler
      git submodule update --init --recursive


The only binary dependencies that you need installed on your system are Boost and Qt5. On Ubuntu the debans can be installed with the command:

    sudo apt-get -y install qtbase5-dev
    
On Fedora

    sudo dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel
    
Then proceed as you would do with any cmake based project

     mkdir build; cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     sudo make install
 
 Note: you should not skip the last installation step. Currently the plugins need to be installed in the folder __/usr/local/lib/PlotJuggler/__ otherwise PlotJuggle will not find them.
 
# Note for ROS users
 
If you use CATKIN to build this project, the ROS related plugins will be automatically included into the compilation.
If you __don't want__ to compile the ROS plugins but catkin is installed in your system,  comment this line in CMakeLists.txt

       find_package(catkin QUIET)

You will also need to download and build this package: https://github.com/facontidavide/ros_type_introspection 
In ROS Indigo and Kinetic, you can just run

       sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-type-introspection
or

       sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-type-introspection
